# 🚀 Overview

**PhishWarden** is a deception-driven cybersecurity system designed specifically for small businesses.

Instead of relying solely on traditional prevention-based security, PhishWarden creates a controlled deception environment that traps attackers, monitors malicious behavior, and protects real assets before damage occurs.

The system focuses on:
- Phishing attack detection
- Credential misuse detection
- Honeypot-based deception
- Real-time attacker monitoring
- Threat intelligence logging

---

# ❗ The Problem

Small businesses are among the most targeted yet least protected organizations against cyber attacks.

## Major Threats

### 🎣 Phishing Attacks
- Fake login pages steal employee credentials
- Attackers gain unauthorized access

### 🔒 Ransomware
- Sensitive files become encrypted
- Businesses risk data loss and downtime

Traditional security systems often fail because:

> Human error remains the weakest security layer.

---

# 💡 The Solution: Deception Over Prevention

PhishWarden introduces a deception-first security model.

Instead of simply blocking attackers:

> The system intentionally redirects suspicious actors into a monitored fake environment.

Inside this environment:
- Every action is tracked
- Every interaction is logged
- Every attempt generates intelligence

Attackers believe they have succeeded.

In reality, they are isolated inside a controlled honeypot system.

---

# 🧠 How It Works

## 🎭 Honeytokens (Bulk Attack Detection)

- Fake high-value credentials are strategically planted
- Example: `admin@company.com`
- Credential usage immediately triggers alerts

Captured Information:
- IP Address
- Browser & Operating System
- Timestamp
- Device Information

---

## 🔐 MFA on Unknown Devices

- Detects suspicious login locations/devices
- Sends OTP verification to the legitimate user

If attacker:
- Fails OTP → Access blocked
- Exceeds attempts → IP blacklisted

---

## 🕵️ Canary Files & Privilege Traps

Inside the deception environment:

- Fake payroll files
- Fake admin panels
- Fake credential vaults

Any interaction triggers:
- Real-time alerts
- Threat analysis
- Canary tracking
- Activity logging

# 📊 SOC Dashboard

The Security Operations Dashboard provides real-time visibility into attacker activity.

## Dashboard Features

- 📍 IP tracking
- ⚠️ Threat severity monitoring
- 📈 Dynamic threat scoring
- 🕒 Attack timeline analysis
- 🚫 One-click IP blocking
- 🔒 Account lockdown controls
- 🔑 Forced password reset system

# 🎯 Why PhishWarden Matters

Traditional security systems are reactive.

PhishWarden is proactive through deception.

| Attacker Action | What They Think | What Actually Happens |
|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Login success | Access granted | Entered honeypot |
| Download file | Retrieved sensitive data | Triggered canary alert |
| Access admin panel | Gained control | Activity logged |

> Every attacker interaction strengthens the defense system.

---

# 🌍 Real-World Inspiration

PhishWarden is inspired by enterprise deception-security systems such as:

- Thinkst Canary
- Honeypot Security Models
- Threat Intelligence Platforms

The goal is to bring enterprise-grade deception security to:

> 💼 Small businesses in a lightweight and affordable form.
